# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository is created for the Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.
The R script to clean up the data is attached as "run_analysis.R" in this repository.
The file "run_analysis.R" can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory.

R script (run_analysis.R) is created to do the following.
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output file in step 5) is also attached as "tidyData.txt".
